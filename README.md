## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the app locally, you need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js: Download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- npm (Node Package Manager): npm is bundled with Node.js, so no additional installation is required.

### Cloning the Repository

To clone this repository to your local machine, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YuviCrypter/yuvis-profile-generator-showcase.git
```

### Installing Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd react-app
```

Next, install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the App

After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the app and open it in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. Any changes you make to the code will automatically be reflected in the browser.
